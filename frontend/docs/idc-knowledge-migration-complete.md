# iDrinkCoffee.com Knowledge Migration Complete

## Summary

Successfully migrated all domain knowledge from `~/idc/CLAUDE.md` to the EspressoBot multi-agent system without losing any capabilities.

## What Was Migrated

### 1. **Shared Knowledge Module** (`/server/shared-knowledge.js`)
A comprehensive JavaScript module containing:
- Business overview and channels
- Product naming and SKU conventions  
- Required and special tags
- Pricing rules and MAP restrictions
- Inventory policies
- Special operations (preorders, combos, open box, MAP sales)
- Metafields structure
- Collections organization
- Workflows and best practices
- Tool usage guidelines
- Integration details
- Common issues and solutions

### 2. **Enhanced Agent Instructions** (`/server/agents/enhanced-instructions.js`)
Domain-specific instructions for each agent:
- **Orchestrator**: Business-aware routing with knowledge of special operations
- **Product Creation**: iDrinkCoffee naming conventions, SKU formats, quality checklists
- **Product Update**: MAP awareness, search strategies, bulk operation guidelines
- **Task Planner**: Workflow knowledge, proper task sequencing for business rules
- **Memory**: Clear boundaries on what to remember vs what's in Shopify

### 3. **All Agents Updated**
Each agent now imports and uses the enhanced instructions:
- `espressobot-orchestrator.js`
- `product-creation-agent.js`
- `product-update-agent.js`
- `task-planner-agent.js`
- `memory-agent.js`

## Benefits of Multi-Agent Architecture

1. **Specialization**: Each agent has focused expertise
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents for new capabilities
3. **Maintainability**: Domain knowledge centralized in shared module
4. **Flexibility**: Agents can be updated independently

## Testing the Migration

To verify all knowledge transferred correctly:

```javascript
// Example: Create a combo product
"Create a combo of Breville Barista Express and Baratza Encore grinder with 10% discount"
// Should route to Product Creation Agent
// Should use COMBO- prefix
// Should link products via metafields

// Example: Update prices respecting MAP
"Update all Rocket espresso machines prices by 5%"  
// Should route to Product Update Agent
// Should check MAP restrictions first
// Should use bulk operations carefully

// Example: Set up preorder
"Set up the new ECM Synchronika for preorder, available in March"
// Should create multi-step plan
// Should add __preorder_auto tag
// Should set inventory policy to CONTINUE
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor agent performance** with the enhanced knowledge
2. **Fine-tune instructions** based on actual usage
3. **Add new workflows** as business needs evolve
4. **Extend shared knowledge** with new learnings

The migration is complete - your OpenAI agents now have all the expertise of the ~/idc agent!
