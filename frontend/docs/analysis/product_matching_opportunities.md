## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Create matches for ECM Synchronika variants as they are high-value ($3,995-$4,195) and available on multiple competitors

2. **Priority 2**: Match Profitec Pro 600 and Pro 500 models - these are popular machines with good competitor coverage

3. **Priority 3**: ECM Mechanika VI Slim - mid-range popular model

4. **Note about Cafe Liegeois**: This competitor seems to focus on bundles rather than individual machines, limiting matching opportunities

## Next Steps
1. Use the intelligent matching API to create verified matches
2. Ensure exact model matching (no similar models)
3. Verify pricing across all matched products
4. Monitor for MAP violations once matches are created
