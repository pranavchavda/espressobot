# EspressoBot Autonomy Improvements Summary

## Problem Statement
EspressoBot was suffering from two critical issues:
1. **Excessive confirmation requests** - Bot asked for confirmation even when given specific values
2. **Massive context loss between agents** - Independently running agents had minimal context, leading to catastrophic failures like updating wrong products

## Root Cause
The architecture had agents running independently with their own RAG/memory access, causing:
- Each agent had different/incomplete context
- No shared understanding of the conversation
- Loss of specific entity references (products, prices)
- No state tracking between operations

## Solution: Orchestrator as Single Source of Context

### Architecture Changes

#### 1. Centralized Context Building
- **Location**: `dynamic-bash-orchestrator.js::buildAgentContext()`
- **Purpose**: Single function that builds rich context objects
- **Components**:
  - Specific entity extraction (URLs, SKUs, prices)
  - Business logic pattern detection
  - Relevant memories from user history
  - Conversation thread history
  - Current tasks and their status
  - Smart context loading (rules, tools)

#### 2. Rich Context Objects
Instead of passing simple task strings, agents now receive:
```javascript
{
  task: string,
  conversationId: string,
  userId: string,
  autonomyLevel: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low',
  specificEntities: [
    { type: 'products', values: ['url1', 'url2'] },
    { type: 'prices', values: ['$899.99'] }
  ],
  relevantMemories: [...],
  relevantRules: [...],
  businessLogic: {
    patterns: [
      {
        type: 'discount_removal',
        action: 'Set base price to compare_at_price value',
        warning: 'Preserve original compare_at_price before updating'
      }
    ]
  },
  conversationHistory: string,
  currentTasks: [...]
}
```

#### 3. Updated Agent Creation
- **Bash Agent** (`bash-tool.js`):
  - Now accepts `richContext` parameter
  - Uses `buildPromptFromRichContext()` to create structured prompts
  - No longer performs its own RAG/memory lookups
  
- **Semantic Bash Agent** (`semantic-bash-agent.js`):
  - Also accepts `richContext` parameter
  - Semantic search is supplementary, not primary context source
  - Orchestrator context takes precedence

#### 4. Business Logic Understanding
- Pattern detection for common e-commerce operations
- Automatic warnings for destructive operations
- Entity tracking to prevent wrong product updates

### Key Files Modified

1. **`/server/dynamic-bash-orchestrator.js`**
   - Added `buildAgentContext()` function
   - Added `analyzeBusinessLogic()` function
   - Updated `spawnBashAgent` to build and pass rich context
   - Updated `spawnParallelBashAgents` for consistent context
   - Stores user message globally for context building

2. **`/server/tools/bash-tool.js`**
   - Added `buildPromptFromRichContext()` function (exported)
   - Updated `createBashAgent()` to accept rich context
   - Maintains legacy mode for backward compatibility

3. **`/server/agents/semantic-bash-agent.js`**
   - Updated `createSemanticBashAgent()` to accept rich context
   - Semantic search now supplementary to orchestrator context

### Benefits

1. **Consistent Context**: All agents see the same information
2. **Entity Preservation**: Specific products/prices tracked throughout
3. **State Awareness**: Agents understand what happened before
4. **Business Logic**: Common patterns recognized and handled
5. **Reduced Errors**: No more updating wrong products
6. **Better Autonomy**: Clear instructions with context = immediate action

### Testing

Created test scenarios in `/server/test-scenarios/test-context-flow.js` to verify:
- Discount removal with specific products
- Price updates with specific values
- Context preservation across agent spawns

### Task Planning Changes

The task planning system has been made orchestrator-driven:

1. **Removed automatic planning** from `bash-orchestrator-api.js`
   - No more `analyzeComplexity()` triggering planning before orchestrator runs
   - Planning only happens when orchestrator explicitly decides it's needed

2. **Updated task_planner tool** in orchestrator:
   - Orchestrator decides what context to pass (not programmatic)
   - Emits proper SSE events for UI integration
   - Only used for genuinely complex multi-step operations

3. **Benefits**:
   - Task planning has orchestrator-provided context
   - No parallel/independent task generation
   - Orchestrator controls when planning is appropriate
   - Simple operations go directly to agents without unnecessary planning

### Context Control Status

After removing all fallbacks:

1. **✅ Task Planner**: Fully orchestrator-controlled, no direct context access
2. **✅ Bash Agents**: ONLY accept rich context from orchestrator (legacy mode removed)
3. **✅ SWE Agent**: ONLY accepts rich context from orchestrator (legacy mode removed)
4. **⚠️ Python Tools**: `memory_operations.py` still accesses SQLite directly (not considered an agent)

### Changes Made to Enforce Orchestrator Control

1. **Removed all legacy fallbacks**:
   - `createBashAgent()` now REQUIRES richContext parameter
   - `createSemanticBashAgent()` now REQUIRES richContext parameter
   - `createConnectedSWEAgent()` now REQUIRES richContext parameter
   - Removed all direct RAG/memory imports from agents

2. **Error handling**:
   - Agents throw errors if richContext is not provided
   - No silent fallbacks to legacy mode

3. **Python Tools Exception**:
   - `memory_operations.py` still has direct SQLite access
   - Uses environment variables for user context
   - Accepted as necessary for certain operations (not an agent)

### Next Steps

1. **Enhanced State Tracking**: Add before/after state capture in orchestrator
2. **Rollback Capability**: Track changes for potential undo operations
3. **More Business Logic**: Add patterns for inventory, tags, collections, etc.
4. **Metrics**: Track context effectiveness and error rates
5. **Testing**: Verify all agents work correctly with required context

## Example: Fixed Discount Removal

**Before**: 
- User: "Remove discount from product X"
- Bot: Updates wrong product Y, loses original prices

**After**:
- Orchestrator extracts product URLs, detects discount removal pattern
- Passes specific entities and warnings to agent
- Agent has full context, updates correct products, preserves data

## Summary

The transformation from distributed context (each agent doing its own lookups) to centralized context (orchestrator as single source) solves the fundamental architecture flaw that caused context loss and erroneous updates.
