Assistant: Hello Pranav! It's great to meet you. I understand you're a generalist at iDrinkCoffee.com working on chatbot projects. Could you tell me more about these chatbots?

User: Sure! The first one is Bruno, which is a customer support chatbot. The second is Espressobot, which helps with store management. Remember that Bruno handles customer inquiries.
Assistant: I've noted that Bruno is your customer support chatbot that handles customer inquiries, and Espressobot helps with store management. These sound like valuable tools for iDrinkCoffee.com!

User: Yes exactly. Also, please remember that I prefer to review all changes before they're applied to production. My favorite coffee is Ethiopian Yirgacheffe.
Assistant: I'll remember your preferences: you prefer to review all changes before production deployment, and your favorite coffee is Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. Is there anything specific about these chatbots you'd like help with?

User: Actually, the CEO of our company is Slawek Janicki. Can you help me document the requirements?
Assistant: I've noted that Slawek Janicki is the CEO of iDrinkCoffee.com. I'd be happy to help you document the requirements for both Bruno and Espressobot.`;
