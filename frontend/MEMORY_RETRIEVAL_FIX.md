# Memory Retrieval Fix Summary

## Issue
Memory retrieval through bash agents was failing because they were searching with the wrong user ID. While memories were being stored correctly with `user_2`, the bash agents didn't have access to the correct user ID when attempting retrieval.

## Root Cause
1. The bash orchestrator correctly passes `userId` to the dynamic orchestrator
2. The dynamic orchestrator loads memories with the correct `user_${userId}` format
3. However, when bash agents were spawned, they had no way to access the user ID
4. Memory operations through the bash agent were failing silently or using wrong IDs

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Python Memory Tool
- Created `/python-tools/memory_operations.py` for bash agents to use
- Reads memories directly from SQLite database
- Gets user ID from environment variable `ESPRESSOBOT_USER_ID`

### 2. Updated Bash Tool Environment
- Modified `bash-tool.js` to pass user ID and conversation ID as environment variables
- Added:
  - `ESPRESSOBOT_USER_ID`: Current user ID (defaults to '2')
  - `ESPRESSOBOT_CONVERSATION_ID`: Current conversation ID

### 3. Updated Dynamic Orchestrator
- Added `global.currentUserId = userId` to make user ID globally accessible
- Clears the global reference after execution for security

### 4. Updated Bash Agent Prompt
- Added memory operations to available resources
- Added examples of memory search commands

## Testing
The Python tool now correctly retrieves memories:
```bash
ESPRESSOBOT_USER_ID=2 python3 python-tools/memory_operations.py get_all --limit 10
```

Returns 10 memories for user_2 with full content and metadata.

## Usage by Bash Agents
Bash agents can now retrieve memories using:
```bash
# Search for specific memories
python3 /home/pranav/espressobot/frontend/python-tools/memory_operations.py search "coffee preferences"

# Get all memories
python3 /home/pranav/espressobot/frontend/python-tools/memory_operations.py get_all --limit 10
```

The user ID is automatically set from the environment, ensuring correct user context.

## Note
Memory addition still requires the JavaScript backend for embedding generation. The Python tool is read-only and will return an appropriate error message if someone tries to add memories through it.
