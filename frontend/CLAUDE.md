## December 10, 2025 - Session Summary: Unified Agent Architecture with Real-Time Task Progress

### 🎯 **Primary Objective Achieved**
Successfully implemented a unified agent architecture with real-time task progress display, replacing the complex multi-agent planner/dispatcher system.

### 🔧 **Key Technical Changes**

#### 1. **Simplified Architecture**
- **Before**: Complex planner-agent.js → dispatcher-agent.js → basic-agent.js chain
- **After**: Single `unified-agent.js` that handles both planning and execution
- **Result**: Eliminated complexity and resource issues

#### 2. **Real-Time Task Display Implementation**
- **Method**: Direct MCP server polling during agent execution (every 500ms)
- **Trigger**: Tasks appear immediately when created by the agent
- **Backend**: Added task fetching in `/server/unified-orchestrator.js`
- **Frontend**: Enhanced SSE event handling for `task_summary` events

#### 3. **Conversation-Aware Task Tracking**
- Tasks are created with `conversation_id` for parallel conversation support
- Tasks are filtered and displayed per conversation
- Proper task persistence across conversation switches

### ✅ **Confirmed Working Features**

1. **Agent Execution**: Unified agent responds without hanging ✅
2. **Task Creation**: Tasks are created with proper conversation IDs ✅  
3. **Real-Time Display**: Tasks appear in UI during agent execution ✅
4. **Data Flow**: SSE events (`task_summary`) sent at correct timing ✅
5. **Frontend Processing**: React component receives and processes task events ✅

### 🔍 **Remaining Issue**
**Visual Persistence**: While tasks display correctly during agent execution, they disappear when the agent completes its response, despite the logic indicating they should remain visible (`shouldShow: true` in logs).

**Root Cause**: The visibility logic is correct, but there appears to be a visual/rendering issue where the TaskProgress component gets hidden or displaced by the agent's response content.

### 📁 **Modified Files**
- `/server/unified-orchestrator.js` - Main orchestrator with real-time task polling
- `/server/basic-agent-unified.js` - Simplified unified agent  
- `/src/features/chat/StreamingChatPage.jsx` - Enhanced task progress UI with sticky behavior
- `/src/components/chat/TaskProgress.jsx` - Task display component

### 🚀 **Architecture Benefits**
- **Performance**: Eliminated resource exhaustion issues (EAGAIN errors)
- **Simplicity**: Single agent vs. complex multi-agent chain
- **Scalability**: Conversation-aware task tracking supports parallel users
- **Real-Time UX**: Tasks appear immediately, not after completion

### 🔄 **Next Steps**
The core functionality is working - tasks are created, tracked, and displayed in real-time. The remaining work is purely visual: ensuring the TaskProgress component remains persistently visible in the UI after agent completion. This is a frontend styling/layout issue rather than a fundamental architecture problem.

**Status**: Real-time task progress **functional** ✅, visual persistence **in progress** 🔄

### 🛠 **Technical Implementation Details**

#### Backend Architecture
- **Unified Agent**: `/server/basic-agent-unified.js` - Single agent with MCP integration
- **Orchestrator**: `/server/unified-orchestrator.js` - Handles SSE streaming and real-time task polling
- **Task Polling**: Every 500ms during agent execution to detect new tasks
- **Direct MCP Calls**: Bypasses agent callbacks using direct subprocess calls

#### Frontend Implementation  
- **SSE Handler**: Enhanced event processing for `task_summary` events
- **Task State**: `currentTasks` and `hasShownTasks` for persistence
- **Visibility Logic**: Shows TaskProgress when tasks exist or have been shown
- **Conversation Isolation**: Tasks filtered by `conversation_id`

#### Key Debugging Insights
- Agent callbacks (`onMessage`, `onStepStart`, `onStepFinish`) not triggered reliably
- Resource issues (EAGAIN) resolved by closing Windsurf/excess processes
- Task creation working correctly, confirmed via direct MCP queries
- Frontend receives `task_summary` events at correct timing
- Visibility condition logic working (`shouldShow: true` in logs)
