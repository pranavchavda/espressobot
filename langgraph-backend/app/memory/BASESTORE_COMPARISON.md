# BaseStore vs Our Custom Memory System - Decision Document

## Date: August 9, 2025

## Decision: Stick with Our Custom System âœ…

### Why We're NOT Migrating to BaseStore (Yet)

#### 1. **We Already Have Everything BaseStore Offers**
- âœ… Semantic search with OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-large)
- âœ… Vector similarity search with pgvector
- âœ… Namespace-based organization
- âœ… PostgreSQL persistence

#### 2. **Plus Advanced Features BaseStore Lacks**
- ðŸš€ **Sophisticated Decay System**: Time-based importance with usage boost
- ðŸš€ **Quality Filtering**: Confidence scores, ephemeral detection at extraction
- ðŸš€ **Feedback Loop**: Tracks which memories actually help in conversations
- ðŸš€ **Usage Analytics**: Access counts, usefulness scores, verification status
- ðŸš€ **Hybrid Ranking**: `(similarity * 0.4 + effective_importance * 0.6)`
- ðŸš€ **Category-Specific Decay Rates**: Preferences decay slower than interactions

#### 3. **What We'd Lose by Migrating**
- Our `calculate_effective_importance()` SQL function
- Memory quality filtering before storage
- Usage tracking and learning system
- Custom decay rates by category
- Memory analytics dashboard
- Fine-grained control over ranking

#### 4. **What We'd Gain (Not Much)**
- Native LangGraph node integration (we don't use StateGraph anyway)
- Simpler API (but less powerful)
- Less code to maintain (but also less features)

## When to Reconsider BaseStore

### Consider Migration If BaseStore Adds:
1. **Advanced Decay/TTL**: Beyond simple expiration
2. **Usage Tracking**: Which memories are accessed/useful
3. **Quality Scoring**: Confidence and importance metrics
4. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Learning from effectiveness
5. **Custom Ranking Functions**: Beyond simple similarity

### Or If We Need:
1. To fully adopt LangGraph's `StateGraph` architecture
2. To share memories with other LangGraph-native tools
3. To reduce maintenance burden (and can accept feature loss)

## Migration Path (If Needed Later)

```python
# Wrapper to make our system BaseStore-compatible
class MemorySystemAdapter:
    """Adapter to expose our memory system as BaseStore-compatible"""
    
    def __init__(self, memory_manager):
        self.memory_manager = memory_manager
    
    async def put(self, namespace: tuple, key: str, value: dict):
        memory = Memory(
            user_id=namespace[0],
            content=value.get("content"),
            category=value.get("category", "general"),
            importance_score=value.get("importance", 0.5),
            metadata=value
        )
        return await self.memory_manager.store_memory(memory)
    
    async def search(self, namespace: tuple, query: str = None, filter: dict = None):
        results = await self.memory_manager.search_memories(
            user_id=namespace[0],
            query=query,
            limit=10
        )
        return [
            {
                "value": {
                    "content": r.memory.content,
                    "category": r.memory.category,
                    "importance": r.memory.calculate_effective_importance()
                },
                "key": str(r.memory.id),
                "namespace": namespace,
                "similarity": r.similarity_score
            }
            for r in results
        ]
    
    async def get(self, namespace: tuple, key: str):
        # Implement if needed
        pass
```

## Summary

**Our custom memory system is superior to BaseStore in its current form.**

We have all the semantic search capabilities of BaseStore PLUS:
- Sophisticated importance decay
- Quality filtering
- Usage tracking
- Feedback loops
- Analytics

The only thing we're "missing" is native LangGraph integration, which we don't need since we're not using StateGraph compilation.

**Recommendation**: Keep our system, monitor BaseStore's evolution, and reconsider only when:
1. BaseStore matches our feature set, OR
2. We need deep LangGraph integration, OR  
3. BaseStore offers compelling new features we lack
