# Agents Integration Summary

This document summarizes the key steps completed to migrate from a Flask backend to a front‑end‑only React/Vite app with Prisma, Express middleware, and the OpenAI Responses API, plus integration of the Shopify MCP tool.

## 1. Removed Flask Backend
- Deleted all Python/Flask code, migrations, services, templates, and related configurations.

## 2. Prisma Client Setup
- Scaffolded `prisma/schema.prisma` and installed `prisma` & `@prisma/client`.
- Introspected the existing Neon DB schema and generated the Prisma client.

## 3. Vite + Express Middleware
- Updated `vite.config.js` to mount an Express `apiApp` for `/api/chat` and `/api/conversations` before the SPA fallback.
- Fixed the `body-parser.json()` import and removed custom history fallback.

## 4. Chat API Implementation
- Created `frontend/server/chat.js` with GET health check and POST endpoint for chat.
- Integrated the Responses API (`openai.responses.create`) using the `web_search_preview` tool and parsed the `response.output` array.
- Persisted user and assistant messages in Neon DB via Prisma.

## 5. Conversation Management Endpoints
- Added `frontend/server/conversations.js` to support listing, retrieving, and deleting conversations.
- Mounted `/api/conversations` routes in the Vite middleware.

## 6. Front‑end UI Wiring
- Updated React components (`App.jsx`, `ChatPage.jsx`) to fetch and display conversations and messages.
- Added support for creating new conversations, sending messages, and selecting threads.

## 7. README & TODO Updates
- Documented NVM/Node 22, Prisma steps, and chat API testing in `README.md`.
- Updated `TODO.md` to reflect completed and upcoming tasks.

## 8. Shopify MCP Tool Integration
- Extended `/api/chat` handler with a `mcp_remote` tool descriptor for the remote Shopify MCP server.
- Tested end‑to‑end flow with the Shopify tool.

## 9. Agent Mode & Task System Iteration

- Orchestrated Master Agent endpoint (`/api/agent/run`) with streaming SSE to handle Planner sub-agent and tool execution.
- Added Planner sub-agent using `gpt-4o-mini` for JSON task plan generation.
- Introduced “Agent Mode” toggle in the UI to switch between chat and agentic workflows.
- Improved TaskProgress component to render subtask content as JSON strings.
- Spawned local memory server (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory`) via NPX in the dev server setup.
- Fixed environment variable fallbacks for the MCP tool server URL.
- Updated Title Creator agent to include the final assistant response before generating conversation titles.
- Implemented full SSE streaming for multi-agent orchestrator, including planner, dispatcher, synthesizer statuses, and token-by-token assistant responses.
- Fixed non-agent mode spinner issue by aligning frontend SSE completion check (`data.done === true`).

## Next Steps
- Integrate full OpenAI Agents JS SDK workflows for multi‑tool planning.
- Scaffold a `/api/agent` endpoint and UI toggle for agent mode.
- Add support for local stdio‑based MCP servers and memory server via `npx`.
- Enhance UI with streaming responses and improved UX, including restoring and verifying planner/task progress display in Agent Mode.
