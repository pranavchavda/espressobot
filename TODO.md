# Roadmap & Next Steps

This document outlines the key next steps for the Shopify Agent Chatbot (frontend-only).

## Immediate Next Steps
- [ ] Scaffold chat UI routes and components (conversations list, message view, input form)
- [ ] Implement loader/action functions for conversations and messages using Prisma client
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI Responses API for basic chat completion flows
- [ ] Wire in OpenAI Agents JS SDK to enable agentic tool chains (e.g., web_search_preview)
- [ ] Configure Prisma schema and migrations for Postgres (Neon DB)
- [ ] Add support for local MCP servers and Node-based MCPS via NPX
- [ ] Write end-to-end tests for front-end actions/loaders and chat flows
